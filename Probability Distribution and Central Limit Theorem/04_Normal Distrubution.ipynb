    "## <b>Normal Distribution</b>\n",
    "### <b>Normal Distribution (a.k.a. Gaussian Distribution)</b>\n",
    "Before we dive into the details, let's understand two key concepts related to normal distribution, mean, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>1. What is Mean?</b>\n",
    "The mean (or average) of a dataset is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Formula:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "mean = (x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn) / n\n",
    "\n",
    "It represents the central value of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>2. What is Standard Deviation?</b>\n",
    "The standard deviation measures how spread out the numbers are from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Steps to calculate standard deviation:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the mean\n",
    "2. Subtract the mean from each value and square the result\n",
    "3. Take the average of these squared differences (this is the variance)\n",
    "4.Take the square root of the variance\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Formula:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "standard deviation (sigma) = sqrt( (1/n) * sum((xi - mean)^2) )\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller standard deviation means the data points are close to the mean. A larger standard deviation means the data is more spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>What is Normal Distribution?</b>\n",
    "```<b>\n",
    "A normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.\n",
    "```\n",
    "It describes variables where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most values cluster around the average (mean).\n",
    "- Extreme values (very high or low) are rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Think of:</b>\n",
    "- Heights of people\n",
    "- Test scores\n",
    "- Measurement errors\n",
    "All tend to follow a normal curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Key Properties:</b>\n",
    "- <b>Mean (μ):</b> Center of the distribution\n",
    "- <b>Standard Deviation (σ):</b> Spread of the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Shape of the Curve:</b>\n",
    "- Bell-shaped\n",
    "- Symmetrical\n",
    "- Peaks at the mean\n",
    "- About 68% of the data lies within ±1σ, 95% within ±2σ, 99.7% within ±3σ → This is the famous 68–95–99.7 Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Formula (Plain Text):</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>f(x) = (1 / (σ * sqrt(2π))) * e^(-(x - μ)² / (2σ²))</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `μ` = mean\n",
    "- `σ` = standard deviation\n",
    "- `e` = Euler’s number (≈ 2.718)\n",
    "- `π`` = pi (≈ 3.14159)\n",
    "This gives the probability density for a given value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need to memorize this formula — but understanding its shape and behavior is essential.\n",
    "\n"
