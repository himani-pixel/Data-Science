    "### <b>What is a Probability Distribution?</b>\n",
    "Imagine you're analyzing real-world data — sales, weather, clicks, heights, etc. You’ll notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some values are more <b>likely</b> than others.\n",
    "- There's a <b>pattern</b> to how data is spread.\n",
    "That pattern is described by a <b>probability distribution.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>In short:</b>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"A probability distribution tells you how likely different outcomes are.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>What is a Probability Distribution?</b>\n",
    "A <b>probability distribution</b> is a <b>mathematical function</b> or <b>table</b> that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assigns <b>probabilities</b> to all possible outcomes of a random process.\n",
    "There are two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>1. Discrete Probability Distribution</b>\n",
    "- For outcomes you can <b>count</b> (e.g. number of heads in 3 coin tosses).\n",
    "- Example: <b>Binomial Distribution</b>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Think: “What’s the probability I get exactly 2 heads in 3 coin tosses?”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>2. Continuous Probability Distribution</b>\n",
    "- For outcomes that can be any number in a range (e.g. height, weight).\n",
    "- Example: Normal Distribution\n",
    "```\n",
    "Think: “What’s the probability someone’s height is between 165 cm and 170 cm?”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>A Simple Analogy</b>\n",
    "#### <b>Let’s say you roll a die:</b>\n",
    "Outcomes = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "Each has a probability of `1/6`\n",
    "This is a <b>uniform distribution</b> (discrete).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine measuring people's <b>heights:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You don’t get fixed values.\n",
    "- Instead, you get a <b>curve</b> — most people around average height, fewer very short or very tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a <b>normal distribution</b> (continuous).\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Why Are Distributions Useful in Data Science?</b>\n",
    "1. <b>Model real-world randomness</b> (user behavior, errors, arrivals, etc.)\n",
    "2. <b>Make predictions</b> (how likely is a customer to buy?)\n",
    "3. <b>Run simulations</b>"
