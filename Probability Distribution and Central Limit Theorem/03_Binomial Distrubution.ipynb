    "### <b>What is the Binomial Distribution?</b>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent yes/no experiments, where each has the same probability of success.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### <b>Think of this:</b>\n",
    "- Toss a coin 10 times\n",
    "- What’s the probability of getting exactly 6 heads?\n",
    "That’s a binomial problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Key Ingredients:</b>\n",
    "- `n` = number of trials (e.g., 10 tosses)\n",
    "- `p` = probability of success (e.g., 0.5 for heads)\n",
    "- `x` = number of successes (e.g., 6 heads)\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Plain Text Formula:</b>\n",
    "<b>P(X = x) = C(n, x) × p^x × (1 - p)^(n - x)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `C(n, x)` is \"n choose x\" = combinations = number of ways to pick `x` successes out of n\n",
    "- `p^x` is the probability of `x` successes\n",
    "- `(1 - p)^(n - x)` is the probability of the remaining being failures\n",
    "- \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "10 coin tosses, what's the probability of exactly 6 heads?\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 10\n",
    "x = 6\n",
    "p = 0.5\n",
    "$$ P(6 heads) = C(10, 6) * 0.5^6 * 0.5^4 = 210 * (0.015625) * (0.0625) ≈ 0.205 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So there's a ~20.5% chance you'll get exactly 6 heads in 10 tosses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python:\n",
    "from scipy.stats import binom\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>When to Use:</b>\n",
    "- Email campaign: Will 40 out of 100 people click the link?\n",
    "- Quality check: How many out of 10 products will be defective?\n",
    "- A/B testing: Will 60 out of 200 visitors convert?"
