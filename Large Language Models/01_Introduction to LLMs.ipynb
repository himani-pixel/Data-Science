    "# Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a breakthrough in artificial intelligence that have transformed how machines understand and generate human language. These models can perform a wide range of tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and even creative writing — all by learning from massive text datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we build a foundational understanding of what LLMs are, why they matter in data science, and how they differ from traditional machine learning models.\n",

    "## What is an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a type of AI model that uses deep learning, specifically **transformer architectures**, to process and generate natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are called *large* because they contain **billions (or even trillions) of parameters** — tunable weights that help the model make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, LLMs are trained to **predict the next word in a sentence**, given the words that came before. With enough data and training, they learn:\n",

    "## Why are LLMs Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility**  \n",
    "  One LLM can perform dozens of tasks without needing task-specific training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero-shot and Few-shot Learning**  \n",
    "  LLMs can handle tasks they’ve never explicitly seen before, based on prompts or a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human-like Text Generation**  \n",
    "  They generate text that often feels natural and human-written.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foundation for Modern AI Applications**  \n",
    "  LLMs power tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, Claude, and many others.\n",
