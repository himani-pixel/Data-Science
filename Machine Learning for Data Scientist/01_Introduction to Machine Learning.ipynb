    "### <b>Common Machine Learning Libraries</b>\n",
    "- <b>Scikit-Learn</b> – Ideal for regression, classification, clustering (beginner-friendly)\n",
    "- <b>TensorFlow</b> – Google’s library for large-scale ML\n",
    "- <b>Keras</b> – High-level deep learning API (comes with TensorFlow)\n",
    "- <b>PyTorc</b>h – Facebook’s deep learning framework\n",
    "- <b>Pandas / NumPy</b> – Data cleaning and handling tools<br>\n",
    "For deep learning beginners: start with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>PyTorch vs TensorFlow</b>\n",
    "- Both are popular frameworks for deep learning\n",
    "- TensorFlow offers more production deployment tools\n",
    "- PyTorch is often preferred for its ease of use and debugging capabilities"
