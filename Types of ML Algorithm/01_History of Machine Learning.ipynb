    "## <b>History of Machine Learning</b>\n",
    "Imagine it’s 1936. The world is on the edge of chaos. But in a quiet university in England, a 24-year-old genius named Alan Turing is sitting in his room... thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not about war. Not about politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "He’s wondering: “What if I could design a machine… that thinks?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This wasn’t science fiction. This was the beginning of a revolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>The Birth of the Turing Machine</b>\n",
    "Alan Turing doesn’t build a robot. He builds an <b>idea</b>. A hypothetical machine — which we now call the <b>Turing Machine</b> — that could simulate any algorithm you can think of, given enough time and tape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: if you can explain the rules clearly enough, this “machine” can follow them blindly and produce the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was like inventing the brain… without the neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Fast Forward to 1950: “Can Machines Think?”</b>\n",
    "In 1950, Turing writes a paper with the boldest question of his time:\n",
    "<b>“Can machines think?”</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that, he proposes a test — later called the Turing Test — where if a machine can fool a human into thinking it’s also human, we must admit it has some form of intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This moment is now seen as the starting pistol for Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spoiler alert: Machines didn’t pass that test then.\n",
    "But they’re getting really close now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Enter: The First Learning Machine (1957)</b>\n",
    "Fast forward a few more years.\n",
    "\n",
    "A psychologist named <b>Frank Rosenblatt</b> creates the <b>Perceptron</b> — the first algorithm that could learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was simple, crude, and limited.<br>\n",
    "But it was a machine that could improve itself<br>\n",
    "That was enough to make the scientific world think.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Headlines declared:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>\"Perceptron could walk, talk, and learn like a baby!\"</i>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay… it was oversold. It flopped.\n",
    "But it planted a seed. And seeds grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>1980s: The Quiet Comeback</b>\n",
    "The world moves on. AI becomes a punchline in computer science. Funding dries up.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in dusty labs and stubborn minds, the idea of <b>machine learning</b> refuses to die.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1986, researchers bring back neural networks — inspired by how our brain works — and this time, the models can finally do something useful. Like recognizing handwriting. Or predicting data trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still early. Still basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the machines were learning again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>1997: Game Over, Humans</b>\n",
    "In 1997, IBM's <b>Deep Blue</b> defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let that sink in:\n",
    "A computer beat the best human in the world… in chess.\n",
    "And not by brute force alone — but by learning and optimizing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, “Can machines think?” becomes less of a joke and more of a warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’d entered the Machine Learning era.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>But How Do Machines Learn?</b>\n",
    "That’s the million-dollar question, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all machines learn the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some learn like students, from labeled examples — we call this <b>Supervised Learning.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some are explorers, figuring things out without answers — <b>Unsupervised Learning.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "And some are more like gamers, trial-and-error addicts, learning from wins and losses — <b>Reinforcement Learning.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what we’ll explore next.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember: It all started with a question in a quiet room in 1936.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question that hasn’t been fully answered yet.\n",
