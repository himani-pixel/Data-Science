    "## <b>Pytorch vs Tensorflow vs Keras</b>\n",
    "Deep learning has transformed industries—from self-driving cars to language models like ChatGPT. But behind the scenes, there are powerful libraries that make all of this possible: <b>TensorFlow</b>, <b>Keras</b>, and <b>PyTorch</b>. Today, we’ll explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why and how each library was created\n",
    "- How they differ in philosophy and design\n",
    "- What a \"backend\" means in Keras\n",
    "- Which one might be right for you\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>A Brief History</b>\n",
    "#### <b>1. TensorFlow</b>\n",
    "- <b>Released</b>: 2015 by <b>Google Brain</b>\n",
    "- <b>Language</b>: Python (but has C++ core)\n",
    "- <b>Goal</b>: Provide an efficient, production-ready, and scalable library for deep learning.\n",
    "- TensorFlow is a computational graph framework, meaning it represents computations as nodes in a graph.\n",
    "- Open sourced in 2015, TensorFlow quickly became the go-to library for many companies and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Fun Fact</b>: TensorFlow was a spiritual successor to Google's earlier tool called DistBelief.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>2. Keras</b>\n",
    "- <b>Released</b>: 2015 by <b>François Chollet</b>\n",
    "- <b>Goal</b>: Make deep learning simple, intuitive, and user-friendly.\n",
    "- Keras was originally just a high-level wrapper over Theano and TensorFlow, making it easier to build models with fewer lines of code.\n",
    "- Keras introduced the idea of writing deep learning models like stacking Lego blocks.\n",
    "<b>Keras was not a full deep learning engine</b>—it needed a \"backend\" to actually do the math\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>3. PyTorch</b>\n",
    "- <b>Released</b>: 2016 by <b>Facebook AI Research (FAIR)</b>\n",
    "- <b>Language</b>: Python-first, with a strong integration to NumPy\n",
    "- </b>Goal: Make deep learning flexible, dynamic, and easier for research.\n",
    "- PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, meaning the graph is built on the fly, allowing for more intuitive debugging and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch gained massive popularity in academia and research because of its Pythonic nature and simplicity.\n",

    "### <b>What Is a \"Backend\" in Keras?</b>\n",
    "Keras itself doesn't perform computations like matrix multiplications or gradient descent. It’s more like a user interface or a frontend. It delegates the heavy lifting to a backend engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Supported Backends Over Time:</b>\n",

    "- <b>PlaidML</b> (experimental support)\n",
    "You can think of Keras as the steering wheel, while TensorFlow or Theano was the engine under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow 2.0 and later, Keras is fully integrated as tf.keras, eliminating the need to manage separate backends.\n",
