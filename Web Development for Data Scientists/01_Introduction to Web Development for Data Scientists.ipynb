    "### <b>Why Learn Web Development as a Data Scientist?</b>\n",
    "Most data science work involves exploring datasets, building models, and analyzing results. However, in many real-world situations, the value of your work increases significantly when others can interact with it. Web development provides a way to make your models and insights accessible through simple user interfaces or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a basic understanding of web technologies allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Present your results beyond notebooks\n",
    "- Create simple forms to collect user input\n",
    "- Serve your machine learning models via a web application\n",
    "- Share interactive visualizations or summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>How Much Web Development is Enough?</b>\n",
    "As a data scientist, you do not need to become a full-stack web developer. Instead, it's more practical to focus on a few key skills that complement your existing workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML to create and structure web pages\n",
    "- CSS to control the appearance and layout\n",
    "- Flask (Python Framework) to build lightweight web applications and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills are sufficient for creating interfaces where users can interact with your models or view results dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>A Practical Approach</b>\n",
    "This course introduces just enough web development to support your work as a data scientist. The goal is to help you understand how to connect the outputs of your models with simple, user-friendly web interfaces using tools you’re already comfortable with—primarily Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with foundational concepts like HTML and CSS, and then move to using Flask for building basic applications."
