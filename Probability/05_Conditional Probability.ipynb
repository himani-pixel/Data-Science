    "## <b>Conditional Probability</b>\n",
    "### <b>What is Conditional Probability?</b>\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event A occurring, given that another event B has already occurred. It helps us update our understanding based on new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote it as:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>P(A/B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is read as: \"The probability of A given B.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Law of Total Probability</b>\n",
    "The <b>Law of Total Probability</b> helps you find the probability of an event `A` by breaking it down based on other known events `B1`,` B2`, ..., `Bn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Formula:</b><br>\n",
    "P(A) = P(A/B1) * P(B1) + P(A/B2) * P(B2) + ... + P(A/Bn) * P(Bn)\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Conditions to Use This Law:</b>\n",
    "1. <b>Partition of the Sample Space</b>\n",
    "The events `B1`, `B2`, ..., `Bn` must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be < b>mutually exclusive</b> (no overlap):\n",
    "No two events can happen at the same time.\n",
    "- Be <b>collectively exhaustive</b>:\n",
    "Together, they cover the entire sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Known Probabilities</b>\n",
    "You must know:\n",
    "- P(Bi) for each event in the partition.\n",
    "- P(A/Bi), the conditional probability of A given Bi.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>P(Bi) > 0</b>\n",
    "The probability of each Bi must be greater than 0, since you can't condition on an impossible event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Real-life Analogy</b>\n",
    "Suppose you have a box containing:\n",
    "5 red balls\n",
    "3 blue balls\n",
    "2 green balls\n",
    "Now, you're told that the ball picked is not green. What is the probability that it’s red?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Example_1.jpeg\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Formula Breakdown</b>\n",
    "If we know:\n",
    "- P(A and B): The probability that both A and B happen\n",
    "- P(B): The probability that B happens\n",
    "Then: <b>P(A / B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: among all the outcomes where B occurs, how many also include A?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Example Problem</b>\n",
    "A class has 60% boys and 40% girls. 30% of the boys and 10% of the girls play football. If a randomly selected student is a football player, what is the probability that the student is a boy?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Example_2.jpeg\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Common Mistakes to Avoid</b>\n",
    "- Confusing P(A / B) with P(B / A)\n",
    "- Forgetting to divide by P(B)\n",
    "- Assuming P(A / B) is the same as P(B / A) — they are not"
