    "## <b>Basic Rules of Probability</b>\n",
    "### <b>1. Important Definitions</b>\n",
    "In probability, understanding the basic definitions is crucial for grasping more complex concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Experiment:</b> An action or process that leads to one or more outcomes (e.g., rolling a die). Deterministic experiments have predictable outcomes, while probabilistic or random experiments have uncertain outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Outcome:</b> A possible result of an experiment (e.g., rolling a 3 on a die).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Probability (P):</b> A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>P(AUB):</b> The probability of event A or event B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>P(A∩B):</b> The probability of both events A and B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <B>Sample Space (S):</b> The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Event (E):</b> A subset of the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Mutually Exclusive Events:</b> Two events that cannot occur at the same time (e.g., rolling a 2 and rolling a 5 on a die). P(A∩B)=0\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Independent Events:</b> Two events where the occurrence of one does not affect the other. P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Certain Event:</b> An event that is guaranteed to happen, with a probability of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Impossible Event</b>: An event that cannot happen, with a probability of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Exhaustive Events:</b> A set of events that cover the entire sample space, meaning at least one of them must occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Example:</b>\n",
    "Tossing a die:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample space: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "Event (E): Rolling an even number = {2, 4, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>2. The Complement Rule</b>\n",
    "The complement of an event A is the event that A does not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notation: Aᶜ\n",
    "- Rule: P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A)\n",
    "#### <b>Example:</b>\n",
    "If the probability of rain today is 0.3, the probability it won’t rain is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(No Rain) = 1 − 0.3 = 0.7\n",
    "\n",
    "## <b>3. The Addition Rule</b>\n",
    "Used to calculate the probability of the union of two events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>For general events:</b>\n",
    "P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>For mutually exclusive events:</b>\n",
    "P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Example:</b>\n",
    "P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.5, P(A and B) = 0.2\n",
    "P(A or B) = 0.4 + 0.5 − 0.2 = 0.7\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>4. The Multiplication Rule</b>\n",
    "Used to find the probability that two events occur together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <bFor Independent events:</b>\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A event A is rolling a 3 on a first throw of a die, and event B is rolling an even number on second throw.\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(A) = 1/6 (rolling a 3)\n",
    "- P(B) = 3/6 (rolling a 2, 4, or 6)\n",
    "- P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = (1/6) × (3/6) = 1/12\n",
    "#### <b>For Dependent events:</b>\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B | A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A bag contains 5 red and 3 blue balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event A be drawing a red ball first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event B be drawing a red ball second.\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(A) = 5/8 (5 red balls out of 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "- After removing one red ball, there are 4 red left out of 7 total: P(B/A) = 4/7\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(A and B) = (5/8) X (4/7)= 20/56 = 5/14\n",
    "\n",
    "So the probability of drawing two red balls <b>without replacement</b> is 5/14\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>5. Independent vs Dependent Events - More examples</b>\n",
    "- <b>Independent:</b> The outcome of one event does not affect the other.\n",
    "    - Example: Tossing two coins.\n",
    "- <b>Dependent:</b> One event affects the probability of the other.\n",
    "    - Example: Drawing two cards without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>6. Mutually Exclusive Events</b>\n",
    "Two events are <b>mutually exclusive</b> if they cannot happen at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example:</b>\n",
    "- Event A: Rolling a 2\n",
    "- Event B: Rolling a 5\n",
    "- These are mutually exclusive because a die can't show both at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Summary</b>\n",
    "This lesson covered key probability rules and concepts that are foundational for more advanced topics like distributions and statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complement Rule: P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A)\n",
    "- Addition Rule for unions\n",
    "- Multiplication Rule for intersections\n",
    "- Understanding independence and exclusivity\n",
