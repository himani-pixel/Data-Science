    "## <b>Introduction to Probability</b>\n",
    "### <b>1. What is Probability?</b>\n",
    "Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). Probability is used to model uncertanity with data and make informed decisions based on that uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Examples:</b>\n",
    "- Tossing a coin\n",
    "- Rolling a die\n",
    "- Predicting customer churn\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>2. Role of Probability in Data Science</b>\n",
    "Probability forms the foundation of statistical inference, machine learning, and decision-making under uncertainty. Data scientists use it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate unknown values from sample data\n",
    "- Evaluate risks and uncertainties\n",
    "- Make predictions using probabilistic models\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>3. Types of Probability</b>\n",
    "#### <b>Theoretical Probability</b>\n",
    "Based on known possible outcomes.\n",
    "- Example: Probability of getting heads in a fair coin = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Empirical (Experimental) Probability</b>\n",
    "Based on observed data.\n",
    "- Example: Probability that a user clicks an ad based on 10,000 past impressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>4. Key Concepts</b>\n",
    "- <b>Sample Space (S):</b> All possible outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "- <b>Event (E):</b> A subset of the sample space; one or more outcomes.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "For rolling a die:\n",
    "- Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "- Event (even number): {2, 4, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>5. Real-World Business Scenarios</b>\n",
    "- Predicting customer conversion rate from a marketing campaign\n",
    "- Estimating product failure rate in manufacturing\n",
    "- Calculating insurance risks\n",
    "- Detecting fraud in financial transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Calculating Probability</b>\n",
    "#### <b>Formula:</b>\n",
    "P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- P(E) is the probability of event E\n",
    "- Number of favorable outcomes is the count of outcomes that satisfy event E\n",
    "- Total number of outcomes is the count of all possible outcomes in the sample space\n",
    "##### <bExample:\n",
    "If you roll a die, the probability of rolling a 3 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(rolling a 3) = Number of favorable outcomes (1) / Total number of outcomes (6) = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667"
