    "\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / P(B)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>P(A / B)</b>is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.\n",
    "- <b>P(B / A)</b> is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred.\n",
    "- <b>P(A)</b> is the prior probability of event A.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be interpreted as:\n",
    "P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / [P(B / A) * P(A) + P(B / No A) * P(No A)]\n",
    "\n",
    "It calculates the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, using the known conditional probability of B given A.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Proof of Bayes’ Theorem</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the definition of conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>P(A / B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</b>\n",
    "2. <b>P(B / A) = P(A and B) / P(A)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "From equation (2), we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "</b>P(A and B) = P(B / A) * P(A)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now substitute this into equation (1):\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / P(B)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Bayes’ Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Example: Medical Test Problem</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a disease affects 1% of the population. A test for the disease has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a person has the disease, the test is positive 99% of the time → P(Positive / Disease) = 0.99\n",
    "- If a person does not have the disease, the test is positive 5% of the time → P(Positive / No Disease) = 0.05\n",
    "- The chance of having the disease → P(Disease) = 0.01\n",
    "- The chance of not having the disease → P(No Disease) = 0.99\n",
    "\n",
    "A person takes the test and gets a positive result. What is the probability they actually have the disease?\n",
