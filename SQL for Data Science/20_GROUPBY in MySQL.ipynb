    "## <b>GROUP BY in MySQL</b>\n",
    "The <b>GROUP BY</b> clause is used when you want to <b>group rows that have the same values in specified columns.</b>\n",
    "It’s usually combined with <b>aggregate functions</b> like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, or `MIN()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are telling MySQL:\n",
    "<b>“Group these rows together by this column, and then apply an aggregate function to each group.”</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Example: Count of employees in each department</b>\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we’re grouping all employees <b>by their department</b> and counting how many are in each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Example: Average salary per department</b>\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We are telling MySQL: <b>“Group the data by department, then calculate the average salary for each group.”</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Using `GROUP BY` with Multiple Columns<b>\n",
    "You can group by more than one column to get more detailed groupings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Example: Count by department and job title</b>\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*) AS count\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department, job_title;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will count how many employees hold each job title within each department.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>The `HAVING` Clause</b>\n",
    "Once you've grouped data using `GROUP BY`, you might want to <b>filter the groups themselves</b> based on the result of an aggregate function. This is where `HAVING` comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "`HAVING` is like `WHERE`, but it works after the grouping is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Example: Departments with more than 5 employees</b>\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "We are telling MySQL: <b>“First group employees by department, then only show those departments where the total number is greater than 5.”</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference Between WHERE and HAVING\n",
    "Clause\tUsed For\tExample Use\n",
    "WHERE\tFilters rows before grouping\tWHERE salary > 50000\n",
    "HAVING\tFilters groups after grouping\tHAVING AVG(salary) > 60000\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use both together:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE status = 'active'\n",
    "GROUP BY department\n",
    "HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what’s happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `WHERE` filters only the active employees.\n",
    "2. `GROUP BY` groups them by department.\n",
    "3. `HAVING` filters out departments with low average salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Using `WITH ROLLUP` in MySQL</b>\n",
    "The `WITH ROLLUP` clause in MySQL is used with `GROUP BY` to add <b>summary rows</b> (totals and subtotals) to your result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Summary</b>\n",
    "Keyword\tRole\n",
    "GROUP BY\tGroups rows with same values into summary rows\n",
    "HAVING\tFilters groups based on aggregate results\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `GROUP BY` when you want to <b>aggregate</b> data. Use `HAVING` when you want to <b>filter those aggregated groups.</b>"
