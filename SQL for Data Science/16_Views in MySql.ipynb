    "## Views in MySQL\n",
    "A <b>View</b> in MySQL is like a <b>virtual table</b>. It doesn’t store data by itself but instead <b>shows data from one or more tables</b> through a saved SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a view just like a regular table: SELECT from it, filter it, join it, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Why Use Views?</b>\n",
    "- To <b>simplify complex queries</b> by giving them a name.\n",
    "- To <b>hide sensitive columns</b> from users.\n",
    "- To show <b>only specific rows/columns</b> from a table.\n",
    "- To <b>reuse</b> common query logic across your app or reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Creating a View</b>\n",
    "Let’s say you have an employees table with lots of details, but you only want to show public employee info (name, department, and salary).\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VIEW public_employees AS\n",
    "SELECT name, department, salary\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re telling MySQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i><b>“Create a view called public_employees that shows only name, department, and salary from the employees table.”</i></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Using a View</b>\n",
    "Now you can query it like a normal table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM public_employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even apply filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM public_employees\n",
    "WHERE department = 'IT';\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Updating a View</b>\n",
    "You can <b>replace</b> a view like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public_employees AS\n",
    "SELECT name, department\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Dropping (Deleting) a View</b>\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP VIEW public_employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes the view from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Notes</b>\n",
    "- Views don’t store data. If the underlying table changes, the view reflects that automatically.\n",
    "- <b>Not all views are updatable.</b> Simple views usually are (like those selecting from one table without grouping or joins), but complex ones may not allow `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.\n",
    "- Views can make your queries <b>cleaner and easier to maintain.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Example Use Case</b>\n",
    "You have this query used 5 times across your app:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customer_id, name, total_orders, status\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE status = 'active' AND total_orders > 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of repeating it, just create a view:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VIEW top_customers AS\n",
    "SELECT customer_id, name, total_orders, status\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE status = 'active' AND total_orders > 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now just do:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM top_customers;\n",
    "```"
   ]
