    "- `DELETE` – Remove records (DELETE)\n",

    "Relational databases store data in structured tables with predefined schemas and relationships between tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Non-relational databases (NoSQL) use flexible formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs, and don’t require a fixed schema (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase). Relational is ideal for structured data and complex queries, while non-relational is better for scalability and unstructured data.\n",
