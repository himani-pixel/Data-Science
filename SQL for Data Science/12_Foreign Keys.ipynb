    "# Foreign Keys\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to create a database, define tables, and use foreign keys to establish relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. Create a Database\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE school;\n",
    "USE school;\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- \n",
    "## 2. Create Tables\n",
    "We'll create two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `students`\n",
    "- `classes`\n",
    "Each student will belong to a class, creating a one-to-many relationship (one class has many students).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create `classes` Table\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE classes (\n",
    "    class_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    class_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Create `students` Table\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    class_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES classes(class_id)\n",
    "        ON UPDATE CASCADE\n",
    "        ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 3. Insert Sample Data\n",
    "Insert into `classes`\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO classes (class_name) VALUES ('Mathematics'), ('Science'), ('History');\n",
    "```\n",
    "Insert into `students`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO students (student_name, class_id) VALUES \n",
    "('Alice', 1),\n",
    "('Bob', 2),\n",
    "('Charlie', 1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 4. Explanation of Foreign Key Behavior\n",
    "In the `students` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `class_id` is a foreign key.\n",
    "- It references `class_id` in the `classes` table.\n",
    "- `ON DELETE SET NULL`: If a class is deleted, the related students will have `class_id` set to `NULL`.\n",
    "- `ON UPDATE CASCADE`: If a class ID changes, it will update automatically in the students table.\n",
    "--- \n",
    "## 5. View the Relationships\n",
    "To check the foreign key constraints:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW CREATE TABLE students;\n",
    "```\n",
    "To see all foreign keys in the current database:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    table_name, \n",
    "    column_name, \n",
    "    constraint_name, \n",
    "    referenced_table_name, \n",
    "    referenced_column_name\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    information_schema.key_column_usage\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    referenced_table_name IS NOT NULL\n",
    "    AND table_schema = 'school';\n",
    "```\n",
    "Understanding `ON UPDATE CASCADE` and `ON DELETE SET NULL`\n",
    "When you define a foreign key in MySQL, you can specify what should happen to the child table when the parent table is <b>updated</b> or <b>deleted.</b> These are called <b>referential actions.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `ON UPDATE CASCADE`\n",
    "<b>Definition</b>: If the value in the parent table (i.e., the referenced column) is <b>updated</b>, the corresponding foreign key value in the child table is <b>automatically updated</b> to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example</b>: Suppose we update a class_id in the classes table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE classes SET class_id = 10 WHERE class_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then all students in the students table whose class_id was 1 will automatically be updated to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `ON DELETE SET NULL`\n",
    "<b>Definition</b>: If a row in the parent table is <b>deleted</b>, the foreign key in the child table will be set to <b>NULL</b> for all matching rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example</b>: If we delete a class from the classes table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM classes WHERE class_id = 2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then all `students` in the students table who were in class `2` will have their `class_id` set to `NULL`, indicating that they are no longer assigned to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use These Options?\n",
    "- `ON UPDATE CASCADE` is useful when the primary key of the parent table might change (rare but possible).\n",
    "- `ON DELETE SET NULL` is helpful when you want to `preserve child records` but indicate that the relationship has been broken.\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternatives\n",
    "- `ON DELETE CASCADE`: Deletes the child rows when the parent row is deleted.\n",
    "- `ON DELETE RESTRICT`: Prevents deletion if any child rows exist.\n",
    "- `ON DELETE NO ACTION`: Same as RESTRICT in MySQL.\n",
    "- `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`: Not supported in MySQL (but available in some other DBMSs)."
