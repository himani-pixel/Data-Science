    "# Joins in MySQL\n",
    "When we have data split across multiple tables, we use joins to combine that data and get the full picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "`students`\n",
    "\n",
    "| id | name  |\n",
    "|----|--------|\n",
    "| 1  | Alice |\n",
    "| 2  | Bob   |\n",
    "\n",
    "`marks`\n",
    "\n",
    "| student_id | subject | score |\n",
    "|------------|---------|-------|\n",
    "| 1          | Math    | 95    |\n",
    "| 2          | Math    | 88    |\n",
    "| 2          | Science | 90    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s see the most common types of joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. INNER JOIN\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to include only the rows that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject, marks.score\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "INNER JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will show only students who have marks recorded. If a student has no marks, they will not appear in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to include <b>all students</b>, even if they don't have any marks. If there's no match in the `marks` table, it will show `NULL`.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject, marks.score\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "LEFT JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when we want to list all students, and show marks only if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to include <b>all rows from the right table</b> (`marks`), even if the student is missing from the `students` table.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject, marks.score\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is rarely used unless we expect some marks that don’t have a student record.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. CROSS JOIN\n",
    "We are telling MySQL to combine every row in the first table with every row in the second table.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT students.name, marks.subject\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "CROSS JOIN marks;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this only when you really want all combinations – it can produce a lot of rows.\n",
