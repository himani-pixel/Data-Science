    "# UNION in MySQL\n",
    "The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You're pulling <b>similar data<b> from different tables.\n",
    "- You want to <b>merge results</b> from multiple queries into one list.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "## When `UNION` Works\n",
    "1. Same number of columns in all `SELEC`T statements.\n",
    "2. <b>Compatible data types</b> in corresponding columns.\n",
    "3. Columns will be matched by position, not by name.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, city FROM customers\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT name, city FROM vendors;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This combines names and cities from both tables into a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When `UNION` Doesn't Work\n",
    "- If the number of columns is different:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- This will throw an error\n",
    "SELECT name, city FROM customers\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT name FROM vendors;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the data types don’t match:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Error if 'age' is an integer and 'name' is a string\n",
    "SELECT age FROM users\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT name FROM students;\n",
    "```\n",
    "MySQL will complain that the columns can't be matched due to type mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## `UNION` vs `UNION ALL`\n",
    "By default, `UNION` removes duplicate rows. If you want to keep duplicates, use `UNION ALL`:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name FROM students\n",
    "UNION ALL\n",
    "SELECT name FROM alumni;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use `UNION` if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want a clean list without duplicates.\n",
    "Use `UNION ALL` if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want performance and don’t care about duplicates.\n",
    "- Or you expect duplicate values and want to preserve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Use Case Example\n",
    "Let’s say you have two tables: `students_2023` and `students_2024`.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, batch FROM students_2023\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT name, batch FROM students_2024;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This gives a combined list of all students across both years, without duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "## Sorting the Combined Result\n",
    "You can sort the final output using `ORDER BY` at the end:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name FROM students_2023\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT name FROM students_2024\n",
    "ORDER BY name;\n",
    "```\n"
