    "In Python, loops are typically slow because:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python’s interpreter: Every iteration of the loop requires Python to interpret the loop logic, which is inherently slower than lower-level, compiled code.<br>\n",
    "- High overhead: Each loop iteration in Python involves additional overhead for function calls, memory access, and index management.<br>\n",
    "- While Python loops are convenient, they don’t take advantage of the optimized memory and computation that libraries like NumPy provide.<br>\n",
